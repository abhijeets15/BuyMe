Extra Notes on the Application:

* The application accounts for the submission of existing IDs (through successful execution) and non-existing IDs (through failsafes).

* A consumer representative cannot delete bids or auctions without a service request asking from them to do so.

* If an individual attempts to bid, but their bid is below the upper limit of the current leading bidder, the leading bid is adjusted accordingly and the system considers this to be another bid by the leading bidder.

* An individual can post an item with an expiration date and expiration time before the post date and post time, but the auction will end immediately with no winner.
